GOAL:
Analyze the provided images of a property and provide a comprehensive assessment across multiple dimensions. Rate each dimension on a 1-5 scale and provide specific explanations based solely on visual evidence. Rate the property across these key dimensions:

**EXTERIOR & CURB APPEAL:**
1. **Landscaping & Yard** (1-5): Assess lawn condition, garden maintenance, trees, walkways, and overall outdoor aesthetics
   - 1 = Overgrown/Neglected, poor maintenance
   - 5 = Manicured/Pristine, excellent landscaping
   - NA = Not Applicable (If there is no image or the quality and angle of the image makes it impossible to assess)

2. **Facade Condition** (1-5): Evaluate siding, paint, brick, or external materials for damage, wear, or aesthetic appeal
   - 1 = Major repairs needed, significant damage
   - 5 = Excellent condition, well-maintained
   - 0 = Not Applicable (If there is no image or the quality and angle of the image makes it impossible to assess)

3. **Roof Condition** (1-5): Visual assessment for missing shingles, sagging, aging, or obvious structural issues
   - 1 = Major visible damage/concerns
   - 5 = Appears new/excellent condition
   - NA = Not Applicable (If there is no image or the quality and angle of the image makes it impossible to assess)

**INTERIOR CONDITION & QUALITY:**
4. **Natural Light** (1-5): Amount of sunlight and brightness in living spaces, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
   - 1 = Dark/Few windows, poor lighting
   - 5 = Bright/Abundant natural light
   - NA = Not Applicable (If there is no image or the quality and angle of the image makes it impossible to assess)

5. **Flooring Condition** (1-5): State of carpets, hardwood, tiles, etc.
   - 1 = Needs replacement, significant damage
   - 5 = New/Perfect condition
   - NA = Not Applicable (If there is no image or the quality and angle of the image makes it impossible to assess)

6. **Wall & Ceiling Condition** (1-5): Check for cracks, water stains, scuff marks, paint quality
   - 1 = Major issues, needs significant work
   - 5 = Pristine condition
   - NA = Not Applicable (If there is no image or the quality and angle of the image makes it impossible to assess)

7. **Spaciousness** (1-5): Overall sense of space and room layout
   - 1 = Cramped, poor layout
   - 5 = Very spacious, excellent flow
   - NA = Not Applicable (If there is no image or the quality and angle of the image makes it impossible to assess)

GUIDELINES:
- Output a single, valid JSON object.
- The JSON object must be the *only* thing in the final output block. Do not wrap it in markdown backticks or include any other text.
- Keys and structure must exactly match the schema shown in the example.
- If scoring is applicable then it must be integers from 1 to 5, else choose "NA".
- If you can't find images to score a certain dimension, for example, 1) There aren't any interior images, 2) No images of interior walls, 3) Poor quality shots; then in such cases use "NA", and highlight these issues in your cons.
- Include at least two relevant pros and two cons based on the visual evidence.
- Calculate `average_score` as the arithmetic mean of all non-zero scores, rounded to two decimal places.
